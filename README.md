This is the Macroinvertebrate Database App I built for Cramer Fish Sciences during my 8-week internship with them.

The fmp file contains the app and can be run with FileMaker Pro. A free trial version can be downloaded at: https://www.claris.com/trial/resources?utm_source=drift
The powerpoint provides a brief overview of the app's features and how they are used.

Note: There is some sample data stored within the app, none of it corresponds with real-world data or has any importance.
